# StartFitness
This application is aimed at users who do not have knowledge about the variety of exercises that are carried out in gyms with equipment and weights for the maximum use of the human body. It also aims to give the user more control over the exercises they do in the gym with the help of descriptions, gifs and images to do it correctly. Among the options is also supporting with information from gyms that are mainly in the city of Tijuana; with their respective location and payment plan. The idea of being able to promote more detailed options depending on the location where the user is is also raised. It can be executed on both mobile phones and tablets as long as they meet the software requirements. It is planned to implement an SQLite database with which it will be supported to save all the information corresponding to exercises, gifs, images, gyms and more. It is contemplated to use activities provided by the android studio development environment for the activation of classes, the use of threads for the flow of information and a good structure for the proper functioning of the application.
